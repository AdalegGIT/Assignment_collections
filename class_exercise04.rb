# Write code to generate a hash where the keys are the numbers from 1 to 50 and the values follow these rules:
#
# if the number is divisible by 2 the value should be one more than the key
# if the number is divisible by 7 the value should be one less than the key
# if the number is divisible by 2 and 7 the value should be the key multiplied by 2
# otherwise the value should be the same number as the key
